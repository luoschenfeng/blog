- audio encoding technique that we just described is called pulse code modulation (PCM)

- A popular compression technique for near CD-quality stereo music is MPEG 1 layer 3, more commonly known as MP3. MP3 encoders can compress to many different rates; 128 kbps is the most common encoding rate and produces very little sound degradation. A related standard is Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), which has been popularized by Apple.

- we classify multimedia applications into three broad categories: (i) streaming stored audio/video, (ii) conversational voice/video-over-IP, and (iii) streaming live audio/video.
